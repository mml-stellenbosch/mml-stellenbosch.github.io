Machine learning has a rich history at [Stellenbosch
University](https://www.sun.ac.za), with research spanning several faculties
and departments. This created a need for a forum to bring together researchers
and students from across the university. This led to the creation of Maties
Machine Learning (MML): a seminar series with short talks on people's current
work, some ML-related topic, or open discussions. Anyone interested in ML is
very welcome to [join](../register) our group.

We meet roughly every second week.  We communicate through our [mailing
list](../register) and this website. Our talks are normally in K303 in the
[Engineering Knowledge Centre](https://goo.gl/maps/mKFrVNjfQfK2), but keep an
eye on the [upcoming talks](../#upcoming-talks) and emails to see the venue
locations for each week.
