Maties Machine Learning (MML) is a seminar series and discussion forum with the goal of bringing together people working on machine learning at Stellenbosch University. We plan to come together every second week, with one or more short talks on people's current work or some ML-related topic, followed by an open discussion. The idea is to get to know what others are working on, and to strengthen machine learning research at Stellenbosch.

## Upcoming talks

**9 February 2018**, 13:00-13:45 in K303 (Knowledge Centre, Engineering)

We will resume our talks again next year. The topic of our first meeting will be announced early in 2018.
