Maties Machine Learning (MML) is a seminar series and discussion forum with the goal of bringing together people working on machine learning at Stellenbosch University. We plan to come together every second week, with one or more short talks on people's current work or some ML-related topic, followed by an open discussion. The idea is to get to know what others are working on, and to strengthen machine learning research at Stellenbosch.

## Upcoming talks

**9 February 2018**, 13:00-13:45 in K302 (Knowledge Centre, Engineering)

Willie Brink - _An introduction to MLNs and their use in visual relational learning_

Markov logic networks (MLNs) combine the expressiveness of first-order logic with the resilience of probabilistic models, and are especially useful when dealing with structured relational data. I will introduce the basics of MLNs, and outline techniques for performing inference and learning in these networks. I will also discuss a Computer Vision application that uses MLNs as a knowledge base in which to learn and reason about object attributes, relations and affordances.
