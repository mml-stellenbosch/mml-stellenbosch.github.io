Maties Machine Learning (MML) is a seminar series and discussion forum with the goal of bringing together people working on machine learning at Stellenbosch University. We meet roughly every second week, for short talks on people's current work or some ML-related topic, and open discussions. The idea is to get to know what others are working on, and to strengthen machine learning research at Stellenbosch.

Stuart Reid - _Deep learning in complex dynamical systems_

One assumption often made by machine learning methods is that the data generating process is stationary meaning that it doesn't change over time. In seemingly stationary environments this assumption can, surprisingly, be unsound. Sensors attached to machinery (including self-driving cars) degrade over time and with them so do the quality and distribution of the data. In dynamical environments this assumption is, unsurprisingly, unsound. Many real-world systems including fluid flows, ecosystems, weather, financial markets, and the human body are nonstationary meaning that the distribution of data in such systems change over time. Such dynamics go by many names: regime changes, phase transitions, or concept drift. One side effect of this is that any model trained on historical data will inevitably deteriorate with time. In this talk I will contrast passive and active approaches for dealing with non-stationarity in complex dynamical systems including: online learning, ensembles, dynamic ensembles, stacking, dynamic reinitialization, adaptive window sizing using change detection tests, and non-contiguous data sampling. These techniques can be used individually or in combination to combat model deterioration.
