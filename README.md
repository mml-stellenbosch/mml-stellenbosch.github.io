Maties Machine Learning (MML) is a seminar series and discussion forum with the goal of bringing together people working on machine learning at Stellenbosch University. We meet roughly every second week, for short talks on people's current work or some ML-related topic, and open discussions. The idea is to get to know what others are working on, and to strengthen machine learning research at Stellenbosch.

# Upcoming talks

**6 September 2018**, 13:00-13:50 in E202 (Auditorium at E&E Engineering)

Jacek Malec - _Teaching robots to manipulate_

Industrial robot systems being deployed today do not contain domain knowledge to aid robot operators in setup and operational use. To gather such knowledge in a robotic context requires mechanisms for entering and capturing semantic data. Such mechanisms would allow a system to gradually build a working vocabulary while interacting with the environment and operators, valuable for bootstrapping the system knowledge and ensuring the data collection over time.

In this talk I will present recent work done in the Lund robotic laboratory that makes the knowledge acquisition easier in the context of kinaesthetic teaching of a dual-arm collaborative industrial robot.
