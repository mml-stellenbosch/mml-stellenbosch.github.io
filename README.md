Maties Machine Learning (MML) is a seminar series and discussion forum with the goal of bringing together people working on machine learning at Stellenbosch University. We plan to come together every second week, with one or more short talks on people's current work or some ML-related topic, followed by an open discussion. The idea is to get to know what others are working on, and to strengthen machine learning research at Stellenbosch.

Ben Herbst - _Tutorial on variational autoencoders_

Variational autoencoders allow the efficient representation of data on a nonlinear, lower dimensional manifold. Since the description of the manifold is probabilistic in nature, it is also a generative probabilistic model allowing the  generation of new samples. The mathematics behind variational autoencoders is actually quite  simple. The difficulty is in understanding _why_ we are doing _what_ we are doing. In this talk I'll explain step-by-step my own efforts at understanding variational autoencoders. You don't need to know what an autoencoder is, you don't even need to know what a neural network is in order to follow the arguments.
