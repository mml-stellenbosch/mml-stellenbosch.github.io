Maties Machine Learning (MML) is a seminar series and discussion forum with the goal of bringing together people working on machine learning at Stellenbosch University. We meet roughly every second week, for short talks on people's current work or some ML-related topic, and open discussions. The idea is to get to know what others are working on, and to strengthen machine learning research at Stellenbosch.

# Upcoming talks

* * *

**14 June 2018**, 13:00-13:45 in E352/353 (Electrical & Electronic Engineering Building)

Ulrich Paquet - _Recent advances in probabilistic inference_ [[slides](http://www2.compute.dtu.dk/~tobo/trends-in-ai2/ulrich.pdf)]

Ulrich is a research scientist at DeepMind. He will discuss recent advances in probabilistic inference, including a few new ideas. Time permitting, he may also touch upon complementary learning systems and their applications in AI.
