Maties Machine Learning (MML) is a seminar series and discussion forum with the goal of bringing together people working on machine learning at Stellenbosch University. We plan to have meetings every second week, with one or more short talks on people’s current work or some ML-related topic, followed by an open discussion. The idea is really to get to know what others are working on, and to strengthen machine learning research at Stellenbosch.
