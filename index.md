Maties Machine Learning (MML) is a seminar series and discussion forum with the
goal of bringing together people working on machine learning at Stellenbosch
University. We meet roughly every second week for short talks on people's
current work, some ML-related topic, or open discussions. The idea is to get to
know what others are working on and to strengthen machine learning research at
Stellenbosch.

Upcoming talks
--------------
Talks will resume at the start of the 2019 academic year.
