Maties Machine Learning (MML) is a seminar series and discussion forum with the
goal of bringing together people working on machine learning at Stellenbosch
University. We meet roughly every second week for short talks on people's
current work, some ML-related topic, or open discussions. The idea is to get to
know what others are working on and to strengthen machine learning research at
Stellenbosch.

Upcoming talks
--------------


**15 March 2019**, 13:00-13:50 in K303 (Knowledge Centre, Engineering)

This week we will have three talks:

- André Nortje - _Deep image compression using BINet_
- Trienko Grobler - _Extracting high-volume traffic routes from ais spatial distribution maps_
- Lydia de Lange - _Machine learning for antenna array failure analysis_

**1 March 2019**, 13:00-13:50 in K303 (Knowledge Centre, Engineering)

_Meet the MML Research Groups_

We are launching a new idea called "meet the MML research groups", where a number of supervisors from across campus will each briefly introduce their group's focus areas and activities.  Our supervisors this week are Arina Britz, Bruce Watson, Corné van Daalen, Hugo Touchette, Sugnet Lubbe and Trienko Grobler.
