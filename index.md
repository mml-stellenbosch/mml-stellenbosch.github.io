Maties Machine Learning (MML) is a seminar series and discussion forum with the
goal of bringing together people working on machine learning at Stellenbosch
University. We meet roughly every second week for short talks on people's
current work, some ML-related topic, or open discussions. The idea is to get to
know what others are working on and to strengthen machine learning research at
Stellenbosch.

Upcoming talks
--------------

**1 March 2019**, 13:00-13:50 in K303 (Knowledge Centre, Engineering)

We are launching a new idea called "meet the MML research groups", where a number of supervisors from across campus will each briefly introduce their group's focus areas and activities.  Our supervisors this week are Arina Britz, Bruce Watson, Corn√© van Daalen, Hugo Touchette, Sugnet Lubbe and Trienko Grobler.
